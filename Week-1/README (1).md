## c. Rendering engine and its use
Answer- The rendering engine is one of the basic components of a web browser. It’s responsible for interpreting the HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and Javascript files to present (render) them on screen, in other words, convert them to pixels.
## e. Script Processors

## f. Tree construction
Answer - To create a tree structure, you have to create a nested HTML list according to the following steps – Create a root unordered list with class="root-tree" . Also, create a span tag with class="tree" within list tag of root list.
## g. Order of script processing
Answer - <script> tags in an HTML document are executed sequentially unless the async attribute is set. This is because they can modify the HTML document (including, for example, adding further scripts that must be loaded and executed before the next script in the original HTML document) via calls to document.write.
## h. Layout and Painting
Answer - Layout computes the exact position and size of each object. The last step is paint, which takes in the final render tree and renders the pixels to the screen. Optimizing the critical rendering path is the process of minimizing the total amount of time spent performing steps 1 through 4 in the above sequence.
